// The first item has an empty name and will be ignored.  You can

// Each line is of the form    name = value
//     value may be omitted.
//     eg:   
//       special abilities = 
//     This line will be interpreted as setting special abilities
//     to the empty string.  This is commonly the default so in
//     many cases it is the same as omitting the line entirely.

// White space is a bit important.  Because names and values can
// contain blanks.  So the rule is....leading and trailing whitespace
// are ignored.  So, for example:
//      attack bonus         =     3         <cr>
//         attack bonus=3<cr>
